# Yume 2kki Variable 44 Range Calculator

Yume 2kki Variable 44 Range Calculator is a C# program that receives a set of inputs to return all the possible values that Variable #44 can take.

Currently, the program functions only through console, and supports Spanish and English, which can be changed in the beginning of the ```Program.cs``` file in the ```Var44``` folder (English is the default language).

## Inputs

As previously stated, this program works only through console. The current admitted inputs are:

* Seishonen's Painting: This refers to the painting in Urotsuki's Dream Apartments. The specific painting is chosen by selecting a number from 0 to 5.
* Numeral Pathways: This refers to the numbers that one can see by the entrance of this world from Check-Disk Nexus. The inputs are received in the following order: Northwest, North, Northeast, West, East, South. If a value doesn't appear, 0 must be inputted instead.

The values where taken from the following sources:

## Planned Updates

* Clean code for better readability.
* Add more language support.
* Allow other alternatives for execution, aside from console.

As this is only a personal project of mine (which I only really made to get the Misplaced in Time badge from YNOproject and to prove to my self that I could), there is no specific date for these changes and they may not even occur at all.
